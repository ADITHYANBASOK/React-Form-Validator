# Form Validation Comparison: React Hook Form vs Formik

This project compares two popular form validation methods in React applications: [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), integrated with [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for schema validation. 

## Features

- **Formik Validation**: Using Formik's form management and Yup for validation.
- **React Hook Form Validation**: Using React Hook Form's simple and performant form management, with Yup for validation.

The app demonstrates both libraries in the same application, allowing users to submit forms that contain different fields (text, file uploads, and passwords). After submission, a success message will be displayed.

### Libraries Used:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Next-generation, fast build tool for React apps
- **Formik**: React form library for managing form state and validation
- **React Hook Form**: A performant, flexible, and extensible form library for React
- **Yup**: JavaScript schema builder for validation
